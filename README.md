Waste GHG Tool is a software tool that allows the user to assess the potential GHG emissions impacts of
different waste management policies that may come into effect in the future and understand from a
GHG point of view what the waste system might look like given availability and combination of various
waste disposal options such as landfill, composting, waste to energy, anaerobic digestion, and
gasification.
The Waste GHG Tool offers significant flexibility, scalability and customization to suit user needs. The
Waste GHG Tool provides the following key features.
This project is to develop an effective web analytics dashboard for waste management scenarios with respect to greenhouse gas emission.
